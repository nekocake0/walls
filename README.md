## about credits

> wheres the credits? dont you wanna credit the creators?

find them yourself, google lens is free after all. i cant search all the wallpapers in this repo to find credits,
it will simply take to much time. 

if your a creator of a wallpaper that is in this repo than create a github issue and ill sort it out
